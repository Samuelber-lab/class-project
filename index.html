        <h2>Overview of Skyline lake</h2>
        <img src="images/map/trail-02" title="Skyline trail" alt="Map of Skyline">
        <p>Skyline Lake is a wonderful, short snowshoe route with enough 
            elevation gain to have a great and an enormous experience. 
            The lake is on Heather Ridge (also known as Skyline Ridge), 
            which is the mountain on the north side of the Stevens Pass.
            On clear days the lake and ridge offer expansive views of
            the Alpine Lakes Wilderness to the south and the Glacier 
            Peak Wilderness to the north. Early in the trip there are 
            nice views of Cowboy Mountain and Big Chief Mountain towering 
            over the Stevens Pass ski area. Comparable views are much harder
            to achieve with other snowshoe trips in the area. On partially 
            cloudy days, the trip is often spectacular with clouds moving 
            through the pass area, partially obscuring the views, and resulting
            in beautiful light conditions for photographers. The lake is a
            popular winter camping destination.</p>
